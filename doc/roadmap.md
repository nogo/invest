# Invest MVP Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the development tasks needed to complete the MVP based on the requirements in `doc/features/mvp.md` and analysis of the current codebase.

## Current State Analysis

### ‚úÖ Already Implemented
- **Event Sourcing Architecture**: Core event store with SQLite
- **Add Trade Form**: Complete trade recording with validation (`RecordTradeForm`)
- **Basic Dashboard Layout**: Main page structure with portfolio summary
- **Investment Chart**: Portfolio value timeline visualization
- **Trade History**: Event listing with search functionality
- **Database Schema**: Event sourcing with Views for read models
- **Internationalization**: Multi-language support (EN/DE)
- **Basic UI Components**: shadcn/ui component library
- **Development Environment**: Bun, TanStack Start, TypeScript setup

### üîÑ Partially Implemented
- **Portfolio Summary**: Basic metrics display but missing key calculations
- **Search/Filter**: Basic search exists but needs enhancement for MVP requirements
- **Position Calculation**: Infrastructure exists but FIFO logic needs implementation

## MVP Development Tasks

### 1. Core Position Calculation Engine üöÄ **HIGH PRIORITY**

#### 1.1 FIFO Position Calculator
- [ ] **Create position calculation service** (`src/features/portfolio/domain/position-calculator.ts`)
  - Implement FIFO cost basis calculation for individual positions
  - Handle partial sells correctly (match oldest buys first)
  - Calculate realized gains/losses from completed sells
  - Calculate unrealized P&L for current holdings

#### 1.2 Portfolio Aggregation Service  
- [ ] **Create portfolio aggregation service** (`src/features/portfolio/domain/portfolio-aggregator.ts`)
  - Aggregate all positions from trade events
  - Calculate total invested amount (sum of all buy trades)
  - Calculate total market value (positions √ó current prices)
  - Calculate total P&L (realized + unrealized)
  - Calculate performance percentage

#### 1.3 Read Model Views
- [ ] **Update database schema** (`prisma/schema.prisma`)
  - Add Views for current positions
  - Add Views for portfolio summary metrics
  - Add Views for realized gains summary

### 2. Current Holdings Display üìä **HIGH PRIORITY**

#### 2.1 Holdings List Component
- [ ] **Create holdings list component** (`src/features/portfolio/components/holdings-list.tsx`)
  - Display current positions with symbol, quantity, value, P&L
  - Show unrealized gains/losses with percentage
  - Include clickable links to asset detail pages
  - Handle empty state when no positions exist

#### 2.2 Position Detail Component
- [ ] **Create position detail component** (`src/features/portfolio/components/position-detail.tsx`)
  - Show position summary (quantity, avg cost, current value)
  - Display unrealized P&L with percentage
  - Show cost basis calculation breakdown

### 3. Asset Detail Page üìà **MEDIUM PRIORITY**

#### 3.1 Asset Detail Route
- [ ] **Create asset detail route** (`src/routes/assets/$symbol.tsx`)
  - Dynamic route for individual asset viewing
  - Handle URL params for symbol identification
  - Integrate all asset-specific components

#### 3.2 Asset Detail Components
- [ ] **Create trade timeline component** (`src/features/assets/components/trade-timeline.tsx`)
  - Show chronological list of all trades for the asset
  - Display buy/sell indicators with prices and dates
  - Show running position calculation after each trade

- [ ] **Create position history component** (`src/features/assets/components/position-history.tsx`)
  - Track how position quantity/value changed over time
  - Show average cost basis evolution
  - Display realized gains from individual sells

#### 3.3 Price Chart with Trade Markers
- [ ] **Create asset chart component** (`src/features/assets/components/asset-chart.tsx`)
  - Basic price chart (manual price entry for MVP)
  - Overlay buy/sell markers on price timeline
  - Show trade quantities and realized P&L on markers
  - Handle cases with no price data gracefully

### 4. Enhanced Dashboard Metrics üí∞ **MEDIUM PRIORITY**

#### 4.1 Portfolio Summary Enhancements
- [ ] **Update portfolio summary components**
  - `src/features/portfolio/components/money-invested.tsx` - Show total invested with trend
  - `src/features/portfolio/components/current-value.tsx` - Show market value with P&L
  - Add new component `src/features/portfolio/components/performance-metrics.tsx` for total return %

#### 4.2 Dashboard Layout Updates
- [ ] **Update main dashboard** (`src/routes/index.tsx`)
  - Add holdings list display
  - Improve metrics layout to match MVP design
  - Ensure responsive design for mobile/desktop

### 5. Enhanced Search & Filter üîç **LOW PRIORITY**

#### 5.1 Global Filter Enhancement
- [ ] **Enhance portfolio filter** (`src/features/portfolio/components/portfolio-filter.tsx`)
  - Add date range filtering capabilities
  - Add trade type filtering (Buy/Sell)
  - Add asset type filtering (Stock/ETF)
  - Ensure filters apply to all dashboard components

#### 5.2 Filter Integration
- [ ] **Update all components to respect global filters**
  - Investment chart should filter by date/symbol
  - Holdings list should filter by symbol/type
  - History list already supports basic search - enhance for other filters
  - Portfolio metrics should reflect filtered data

### 6. Trade Management Features ‚úèÔ∏è **LOW PRIORITY**

#### 6.1 Trade Editing
- [ ] **Create edit trade functionality**
  - Add edit route (`src/routes/history/$eventId/edit.tsx`)
  - Create edit form component (extend existing RecordTradeForm)
  - Implement trade correction events (maintain event sourcing integrity)
  - Add edit links to history items

#### 6.2 Trade Deletion  
- [ ] **Create delete trade functionality**
  - Implement soft deletion via compensating events
  - Add confirmation dialog for trade deletions
  - Update history to show deleted/corrected trades
  - Ensure position calculations handle deleted trades correctly

### 7. Price Data Management üí± **FUTURE/OPTIONAL**

#### 7.1 Manual Price Entry (MVP Requirement)
- [ ] **Create price management system**
  - Simple price entry form for current asset prices
  - Store latest prices for portfolio value calculation
  - Basic price history for chart functionality
  - Default to last traded price when available

## Implementation Order

### Phase 1: Core Functionality (Weeks 1-2)
1. FIFO Position Calculator
2. Portfolio Aggregation Service  
3. Holdings List Component
4. Enhanced Portfolio Summary

### Phase 2: Asset Details (Weeks 3-4)
1. Asset Detail Route and Components
2. Trade Timeline
3. Basic Price Chart with Trade Markers

### Phase 3: Enhanced Features (Weeks 5-6)
1. Enhanced Search/Filter
2. Trade Editing/Deletion
3. Manual Price Entry System

### Phase 4: Polish & Testing (Week 7)
1. Error handling and edge cases
2. Performance optimization
3. Mobile responsiveness
4. Testing and bug fixes

## Key Technical Decisions Needed

### Questions for Clarification:

1. **Price Data Source**: How should current asset prices be handled in MVP? 
   - Manual entry form for each asset?
   - Use last traded price as default?
   - External API integration (outside MVP scope)?

2. **Currency Handling**: MVP mentions "EUR only" - should we:
   - Hard-code EUR display everywhere?
   - Add currency field but limit to EUR in forms?
   - Store currency per trade for future multi-currency support?

3. **Trade Notes**: Current form has notes field - should this be:
   - Displayed in holdings/asset detail views?
   - Searchable in global filter?
   - Used for any specific calculations?

4. **Performance Considerations**: For large portfolios:
   - Should position calculations be cached in database views?
   - Real-time calculation vs. periodic updates?
   - Pagination for large trade histories?

## Success Criteria

The MVP will be considered complete when:

- [ ] Users can add buy/sell trades with all required fields
- [ ] Dashboard shows accurate total invested, market value, and P&L
- [ ] Current holdings list displays all positions with correct FIFO cost basis
- [ ] Asset detail pages show complete trade history and position evolution
- [ ] Global search/filter works across all views
- [ ] Basic price chart shows trade markers
- [ ] All calculations follow FIFO methodology correctly
- [ ] Application handles edge cases (no trades, no positions, etc.)
